## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of HTML/CSS.
- Optionally, Tailwind CSS enabled in your project for advanced customization.


### Usage

You can easily add the footer to your site via CDN or by including the JavaScript files as shown below:

```html
<!-- Add footer via CDN -->
<script src="https://cdn.example.com/footer.js"></script>

<!-- or Include footer-light.js for light theme -->
<script src="https://cdn.example.com/footer-light.js"></script>
```

Alternatively, clone this repository and include the `footer.js` or `footer-light.js` files directly in your project.

### Example

Here's a simple example of adding the footer to your HTML page:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1" />
  <title>Sample Page</title>
</head>
<body>

  <!-- Your page content -->

  <!-- Footer script -->
  <script src="footer.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```


## Customization

- Modify or extend the existing footers by editing the JavaScript files.
- Adjust styles using Tailwind CSS classes or add your own CSS for further personalization.
- Add or remove social links by modifying the footer HTML or JS files.
